<!-- I joined the Flatiron Institute, Simons Foundation in 2016 as part of the Center for Computational Biologyâ€™s biophysical modeling group. My research focuses on understanding the phenomena and exploring future applications in biophysics and active matter. My research interest spans from general fundamental theories to high performance computing algorithms & applications. I consider my role in academia as a combination of an applied mathematician, a theoretical physicist, and a computational engineer. -->
